# Burnt-Coffee-VS-Theme
Easy on eyes yet beautiful theme for VS Code / Cursor IDE

# Installation
1) Open VS Code alternatively Cursor IDE
2) Go to '>Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)'
3) replace the textMateRules array with tokenColors array
4) replace the workbench.colorCustomizations object with the colors object

# NOTE the settings.json file should still be named textMateRules and workbench.colorCustomizations
# If you don't have a "textMateRules" or "workbench.colorCustomizations" you can create them
